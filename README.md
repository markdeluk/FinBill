Yet another app to manage expenses.

There are already some applications available on Google Play Store that provide lots of features regarding expense management, but sometimes they are difficult to use, and/or you have to pay a subscription for them.
This project aims to propose a free and easy-to-use accounting application which tracks personal expenses dividing them by category, possibly recording recurrent ones (like subscriptions, bills, taxesâ€¦).
